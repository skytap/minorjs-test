Functional testing framework for the [MinorJS web framework](https://github.com/skytap/minorjs).

# Installation

This package is available on npm as:

```

# Features

* Makes requests to your site with a fast, headless browser.
* Automatically starts and shuts down your HTTP server.
* Uses jQuery-style selectors to access data in the DOM.
* Build your tests with standard tools like Mocha and Should.
* Baked in support for `@manual` and `@nozombie` tags in Cucumber tests.

# MinorJS web framework

MinorJS Test is purpose-built to test [MinorJS web applications](https://github.com/skytap/minorjs).
MinorJS is a clustered web framework for Node.js that favors convention over configuration.

# CoffeeScript-friendly

While MinorJS Test is written in Javascript, the testing framework happily works with CoffeeScript.
